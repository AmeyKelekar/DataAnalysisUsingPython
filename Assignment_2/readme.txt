1) There are 2 scripts designed for this assignment:
	a) Assignment2_SearchAndSave.py : 
		This script saves the tweet details fetched in a csv file. I am using the Twitter Search API.
		Resource URL: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json

		When we are following an event thatâ€™s currently happening, we would be interested in search for recent tweets using the event hashtag:
		For example:
		You want: recent tweets that contain the hashtag #superbowl
